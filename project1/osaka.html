        <p>Ōsaka, city and capital of Ōsaka fu (urban prefecture), south-central Honshu, Japan. 
            The city, together with its neighbouring city Kōbe and nearby Kyōto, are the centres of the Keihanshin Industrial Zone, the second largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ōsaka lies along Ōsaka Bay at the eastern end of the Inland Sea, on the delta of the Yodo River. Its metropolitan area is spread over the deltas and into the alluvial uplands of the Yodo, Yamato, and other rivers. Kōbe lies on the northwestern shore of Ōsaka Bay, about 20 miles (30 km) west of Ōsaka. 
            The climate is temperate, with cool winters and hot, humid summers; annual rainfall is about 54 inches (1,360 mm). The area is subject to typhoons in September, which occasionally are disastrous.
